# 📊 Monitoring & Observability Stack — DevOps Reference

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a **containerized monitoring, alerting, and logging stack** designed to demonstrate **real-world observability practices** used in production DevOps environments.

It reflects how system and application observability is implemented where:
- DevOps engineers own monitoring, alerting, and logging infrastructure
- Applications and services run on Dockerized and VM-based environments
- Centralized visibility is required for system health, uptime, and troubleshooting

> ⚠️ This repository focuses on **monitoring and observability infrastructure**, not application source code.

## 🟢 Prometheus

📁 prometheus/

- Containerized Prometheus server

- Scrapes metrics from:

    - Node Exporter

    - Docker containers

    - Blackbox Exporter targets

- Includes alerting rules and secure web configuration

Key files:

- prometheus.yaml — scrape configs & targets

- rules/ — alert rules

- web-config.yaml — HTTP/HTTPS & security settings

- Dockerfile — custom Prometheus image

## 🚨 Alertmanager

📁 alertmanager/

- Handles alerts generated by Prometheus

- Supports alert grouping, routing, and notification logic

- Deployed as a containerized service

Key files:

- alertmanager.yaml — alert routing & notification configuration

- Dockerfile — containerized Alertmanager setup

## 🌐 Blackbox Exporter

📁 blackbox/

- Used for endpoint and service availability monitoring

- Performs HTTP, TCP, and ICMP probes

- Integrated with Prometheus for uptime checks

Key file:

- config.yaml — probe definitions and timeouts

## 🧾 Loki & Promtail (Centralized Logging)

📄 loki-config.yaml
📄 promtail-config.yaml

- Loki is used for centralized log aggregation

- Promtail collects logs from services (e.g., Nginx, system logs)

- Logs are visualized and queried via Grafana

This setup demonstrates:

- Lightweight log aggregation

- Label-based log querying

- Tight integration with Grafana dashboards

## 📈 Grafana (Visualization Layer)

- Grafana is run using Docker (docker run)

- Connected to:

    - Prometheus (metrics)

    - Loki (logs)

- Used to visualize:

    - System metrics

    - Container health

    - Service uptime

    - Log streams

Grafana dashboards are created and managed at runtime and are not stored as application code in this repository.
